  <p>Every technology shift is an opportunity to advance scientific discovery, accelerate human progress, 
    and improve lives. I believe the transition we are seeing right now with AI will be the most profound in our 
    lifetimes, far bigger than the shift to mobile or to the web before it. AI has the potential to create 
    opportunities — from the everyday to the extraordinary — for people everywhere. It will bring new waves of
    innovation and economic progress and drive knowledge, learning, creativity and productivity on a scale we haven’t 
    seen before.

  <p>Nearly eight years into our journey as an AI-first company, the pace of progress is only accelerating: Millions of people are now using generative AI across our products to do things they couldn’t even a year ago, from finding answers to more complex questions to using new tools to collaborate and create. At the same time, developers are using our models and infrastructure to build new generative AI applications, and startups and enterprises around the world are growing with our AI tools.</p>  </div>
